# PowerAutoPwn
Testing Microsoft Power Automate as an offensive security tool.

Just like usual, I was sitting around on the computer minding my own business when suddenly I noticed a tool called "Microsoft Power Automate" on my computer.  It must come bundled with Office 365, which I had recently purchased.
I am a huge fan of lowcode/nocode because I think it makes coding more accessible to people.  

To use any of the scripts I put here, just copy the text and paste it into your Power Automate "flow".  After pasting, you should get a nice visual representation of what the code does.

Good luck, and be careful.  A lot of the research I do is kind of a fringe area so use common sense before you run anything here.

Some immediate improvements that can be made to the s3 script in its current form:

1) Do more validation with errors
2) log errors to a database or file
3) remove error entries from the CSV
4) Have file paths/file names/etc not be hardcoded.
